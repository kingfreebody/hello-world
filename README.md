Learning to use git

It's great to learn things. However, because life is short and if we are lucky ends in old age, sickness and death, we should beware of what we spend our time learning. Preferrably we should learn things that we can use even when on our deathbed! That means things like becoming an accomplished meditator with great realizations, even full enlightenment, with nirodha samapati and all five mundane psychic powers. Second best is learning things that we need to pave the way to becoming what has been laid out in the first point.
